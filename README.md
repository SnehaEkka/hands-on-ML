# Hands-on ML mini projects

A curated collection of practical machine learning and analytics exercises developed during the Boston University MSBA program (Fall 2024 â€“ Spring 2025). Projects in this repository emphasize reproducible workflows, analytical clarity, and business-relevant insights through hands-on work with real-world datasets.

## Highlights

- **Comprehensive Data Pipelines:** Each notebook demonstrates full-cycle analytics, from raw data cleaning and feature engineering to advanced modeling and interpretability.
- **Diverse Analytical Techniques:** Covers major themes in supervised learning, unsupervised clustering, pattern mining, dimensionality reduction, and natural language processing, suited to a wide variety of strategic, operational, and analytical challenges.
- **Emphasis on Reproducibility:** Modular code organization using Python, scikit-learn pipelines, and well-commented Jupyter notebooks reinforces best practices for analytics and engineering tasks.
- **Applied to Real-world Data:** Exercises leverage datasets from finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and text domains, highlighting strong data wrangling and model selection skills transferable to client and industry projects.
- **Clear Communication:** Includes summaries, interpretations, and visualizations that make insights accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences, valuable for consulting, stakeholder communication, and analytics storytelling.
